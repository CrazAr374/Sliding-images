### **Repository Name**: Responsive 3D Image Slider Website

#### **Description**:
This repository contains the source code for a fully responsive website with a stunning 3D image slider, built using only **HTML** and **CSS** (no JavaScript!). The site features advanced animations, custom typography, and a modern UI, making it a perfect demonstration of how to create an immersive web experience using CSS techniques alone.

---

#### **Features**:
- **3D Image Carousel**: A rotating image slider built with CSS3's `perspective` and `rotateY`. It smoothly animates through images in a 3D space without the need for JavaScript.
- **Custom Typography**: Stylish fonts such as **ICA Rubrik Black** for headings and **Poppins** for the body text, imported via Google Fonts.
- **CSS Animations**: The carousel leverages CSS `@keyframes` for continuous and smooth rotations.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile), using media queries to adapt the slider size, typography, and layout.
- **Background Effects**: Repeating linear gradients and background images provide a modern, textured look.
